The main taxonomy in the theme is `tags`, as it is the one listed under the title in every "single" page, but it's also possible to set any number of arbitrary taxonomies which will be listed in the side pane details section.

For example, in this site there's the taxonomies `topic` and `series` as defined in the config file.

```toml
[taxonomies]
 tag = 'tags'
 topic = 'topics'
 series = 'series'
```
